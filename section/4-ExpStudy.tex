\section{Experimental Study}
\paragraph{Statistical Analysis.}
Display the clustering of metrics through multiple perspectives,
such as the similarity of their distribution plots, tables of Pearson and Spearman Correlation
and the visualization outcomes of a certain clustering algorithm.

\paragraph{Qualitative Analysis.}
Display and analyze some examples where different metrics disagree greatly.
For example, a response with no n-gram overlap will get zero BLEU but if it is semantically
relevant to the message or reference, embedding-based metric will give it a high score.
